### Banking Management System

Vertical Slice Architecture + NLayer Architecture 

Database backup file is [here](BankingManagementSystem.sql).

The **DotNet8.BankingManagementSystem** project is structured to implement a banking management system using **.NET 8**. Here's an overview of the project structure based on the repository's content:

- **Backend Services**: This layer contains the business logic and service layer for the application. It references the Database, Mapper, Models, and Shared projects to perform its operations².
- **Common**: This project includes common elements that are shared across different layers of the application, such as global settings and utilities².
- **Database**: This project manages the database operations, likely including entity definitions and the data access layer².
- **Frontend**: While not detailed in the search results, this would typically contain the user interface components of the application.
- **Mapper**: This project is responsible for mapping between different data models, which is a common practice in applications to separate the internal data representation from the external one².
- **Models**: This project defines the data models used throughout the application².
- **Shared**: This project likely contains shared resources and components that can be used by both the frontend and backend².

The project seems to follow a **Vertical Slice Architecture** combined with an **NLayer Architecture**, which means that each feature or slice of the application is developed independently across all the layers from the database to the user interface. This approach allows for better modularity and separation of concerns.
